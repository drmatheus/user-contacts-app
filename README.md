The React frontend for the Customer Management API consists of a login page, register page, and a homepage. It also includes modals for editing and deleting contacts. The frontend application allows users to authenticate themselves with the login page and create new accounts with the register page. Once logged in, users are directed to the homepage where they can view a list of customers and their contact information. The modals provide functionality for editing and deleting contacts associated with each customer, allowing users to update or remove contact details as needed. The frontend application provides a streamlined user experience, facilitating the management of customer data and associated contacts.
